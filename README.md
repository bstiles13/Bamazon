# Bamazon

I recorded a demo of my Bamazon app here:

The Customer application gives the user (customer) the option to buy from the Bamazon store. A table will display in Node which consist of an item id, product name, department name, price and stock quantity. A user must log in or create a new account before he/she may purchase. The login feature also includes a 'Forgot my Password' method. Data persistence is stored in MySQL.

The Manager application has the option to view the products for sale, view products that are low in stock quantity, add a new product, and add quantity to existing products.

The Supervisor application has the option to view product sales by customer, view product sales by department, and create new departments.
